				<h1>Rohin Tamang</h1>
				<p>"It's a country between India and China." I explained, before biting into my burger, when asked yet again where Nepal is located, at least this time they did not assume it was a city in India. When I tell people that I am from Nepal many have no idea that it is a country much less that eating beef there is punishable by death. In the beginning I used to find that annoying, but as time passed and I adjusted into the true melting pot of American culture it stopped bothering me, especially when I realized I am not a master of geography myself. </p>

				<p>I grew up on the outskirts of the Kathmandu valley and from an early age I was able to see and experience many cultures as my mom raised me in a hostile that catered to many foreign travelers. I remember playing with toys from other countries and trying international foods at 5/6 years old. It cultivated this desire to travel and experience even more. I watched American cartoons to practice my English and although I had limited access to computers I remember taking apart my first computer and putting it back together at 8 years old. My curiosity was the root of it all, see I didn't just want to travel and experience things for the "memories" I wanted to study and understand things. The accomplishment I felt in putting that computer back together solidified my dreams. I knew I had to make it happen.</p>

				<p>Fast-forward to college applications with high-hopes of one day becoming a web-developer and eventually a software engineer, a visa interview and a one-way ticket later and here I am \, eating a juicy beef burger in America the ultimate melting pot of cultures and experiences, typing this - an assignment for my future. I wish I could say I knew all the right turns that led me here, and that every moment of every day led to this specific point in time where I can live out my passion - but that would be untrue. </p>

				<p>The truth? I fed my curiosity, hit a few bumps in the road, made a right turn and then maybe two lefts. Life is this amazing and intricate puzzle I am still piecing together and just like coding there can be a million different outcomes depending on what I input.  </p>
